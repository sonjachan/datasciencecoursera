```{r setup, include=FALSE}

And the [repo](https://github.com/sonjachan/datasciencecoursera) of this course

I hope I could do more in the future. Like the table and plot below. It's quite difficult, but intersting.

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```



```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
